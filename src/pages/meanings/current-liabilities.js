    <Content>
      Current liabilities are a company's debts or obligations that are due
      within one year or within a normal operating cycle. Furthermore, current
      liabilities are settled by the use of a current asset, such as cash, or by
      creating a new current liability. Current liabilities appear on a
      company's balance sheet and include short-term debt, accounts payable,
      accrued liabilities, and other similar debts.

      Analysts and creditors often use the current ratio (current assets divided
      by liabilities), or the quick ratio (current assets minus inventories
      divided by current liabilities), to determine whether a company is able to
      pay off its current liabilities.
