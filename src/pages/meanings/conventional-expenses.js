  <Meaning title="Prepaid Expense">
    <Content>
      A prepaid expense is a type of asset that arises on a balance sheet as a
      result of business making payments for goods and services to be received
      in the future. Prepaid expenses are initially recorded as assets, but
      their value is expensed over time as the benefit is received onto the
      income statement, because unlike conventional expenses, the business will
      receive something of value in the near future.

      Companies make prepayments for goods or services such as equipment or
      insurance coverage that provide continual benefits over time. Goods or
      services of this nature cannot be expensed immediately and entirely as a
      cost to revenue on the income statement in one single accounting period.
      Instead, they must be recorded as assets on the balance sheet at the time
      of their purchases before being used or consumed. To record a prepayment,
      companies debit the equipment or insurance policy account, and credit the
      cash account, assuming no trade credit — an agreement in which a customer
      can purchase goods on account (without paying cash), paying the supplier
      at a later date — is used. This effectively increases the amount in the
      prepaid-expense asset account and reduces the cash balance.
