    <Content>
      An asset is a resource with economic value that an individual, corporation
      or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide a
      future benefit. Assets are reported on a company's balance sheet and are
      bought or created to increase a firm's value or benefit the firm's
      operations. An asset can be thought of as something that, in the future,
      can generate cash flow, reduce expenses or improve sales, regardless of
      whether it's manufacturing equipment or a patent.

    <Content>
      An asset represents an economic resource for a company or represents
      access that other individuals or firms do not have. A right or other
      access is legally enforceable, which means economic resources can be used
      at a company's discretion, and its use can be precluded or limited by an
      owner. For an asset to be present, a company must possess a right to it as
      of the date of the financial statements. An economic resource is something
      that is scarce and has the ability to produce economic benefit by
      generating cash inflows or decreasing cash outflows.
