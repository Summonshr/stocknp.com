      Inventory is the term for the goods available for sale and raw materials
      used to produce goods available for sale. Inventory represents one of the
      most important assets of a business because the turnover of inventory
      represents one of the primary sources of revenue generation and subsequent
      earnings for the company's shareholders.

      Inventory is the array of finished goods or goods used in production held
      by a company. Inventory is classified as a current asset on a company's
      balance sheet, and it serves as a buffer between manufacturing and order
      fulfillment. When an inventory item is sold, its carrying cost transfers
      to the cost of goods sold (COGS) category on the income statement.

      Inventory is generally categorized as raw materials, work-in-progress, and
      finished goods. Raw materials are unprocessed materials used to produce a
      good. Examples of raw materials include aluminum and steel for the
      manufacture of cars, flour for bakeries production of bread, and crude oil
      held by refineries.

      Work-in-progress inventory is the partially finished goods waiting for
      completion and resale; work-in-progress inventory is otherwise known as
      inventory on the production floor. For example, a half-assembled airliner
      or a partially completed yacht would be work-in-process.

      Finished goods are products that have completed production and are ready
      for sale. Retailers typically refer to this inventory as "merchandise".
      Common examples of merchandise include electronics, clothes, and cars held
      by retailers.
