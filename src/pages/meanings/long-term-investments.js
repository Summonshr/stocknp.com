    <Content>
      A long-term investment is an account on the asset side of a company's
      balance sheet that represents the company's investments, including stocks,
      bonds, real estate and cash, that it intends to hold for more than a year.
      The long-term investment account differs largely from the short-term
      investment account in that the short-term investments will most likely be
      sold, whereas the long-term investments may never be sold.
