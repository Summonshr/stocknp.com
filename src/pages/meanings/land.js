      Land is real estate or property, minus buildings and equipment, that is
      designated by fixed spatial boundaries. Land ownership may offer the title
      holder the right to natural resources on the land. The traditional school
      of economics dictates that land is a factor of production, along with
      capital and labor. The sale of land results in capital gain or loss; under
      IRS tax laws, land is not a depreciable asset.
