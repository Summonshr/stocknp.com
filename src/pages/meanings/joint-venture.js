      A joint venture (JV) is a business arrangement in which two or more
      parties agree to pool their resources for the purpose of accomplishing a
      specific task. This task can be a new project or any other business
      activity. In a joint venture (JV), each of the participants is responsible
      for profits, losses and costs associated with it. However, the venture is
      its own entity, separate from the participants' other business interests.
