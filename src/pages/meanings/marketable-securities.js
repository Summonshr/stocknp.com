    <Content>
      Marketable securities are liquid financial instruments that can be quickly
      converted into cash at a reasonable price. The liquidity of marketable
      securities comes from the fact that the maturities tend to be less than
      one year, and that the rates at which they can be bought or sold have
      little effect on prices.
