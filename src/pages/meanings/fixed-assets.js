      Fixed assets are long-term resources, such as plants, equipment and
      buildings. An adjustment for the aging of fixed assets is made based on
      periodic charges called depreciation, which may or may not reflect the
      loss of earning powers for a fixed asset. Generally accepted accounting
      principles (GAAP) allow depreciation under two broad methods: The
      straight-line method assumes that a fixed asset loses its value in
      proportion to its useful life, while the accelerated method assumes that
      the asset loses its value faster in its first years of use.
