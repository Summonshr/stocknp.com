      A plant asset is an asset with a useful life of more than one year that is
      used in producing revenues in a business's operations. Examples of plant
      assets include land, land improvements, buildings, machinery and
      equipment, office equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, leasehold
      improvements, and construction work-in-progress. Plant assets are also
      referred to as fixed assets and/or property, plant and equipment.

      Plant assets are recorded at cost and depreciation is reported during
      their useful lives. (However, there is no depreciation of land, and the
      depreciation for construction work-in-progress begins when the asset is
      placed into service.) The cumulative amount of depreciation is reported in
      the contra plant asset account Accumulated Depreciation.

      company's balance sheet in the noncurrent asset section entitled property,
      plant and equipment. Accounting rules also require that the plant assets
      be reviewed for possible impairment losses.
