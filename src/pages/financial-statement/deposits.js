      When an individual deposits money into a banking account, it earns interest. This means that, at fixed intervals, a small percentage of the account's total is added to the amount of money already in the account. Interest can compound at different rates and frequencies depending on the bank or institution. Time deposits, CDs, and other accounts that restrict withdrawals offer a higher interest rate, which allows you to save more money more quickly.
