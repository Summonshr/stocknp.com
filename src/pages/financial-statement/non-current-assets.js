            Non-current assets are assets that are not turned into cash easily, are expected to be turned into cash within a year, and/or have a lifespan of more than a year. They can refer to tangible assets such as machinery, computers, buildings and land. Non-current assets also can be intangible assets such as goodwill, patents or copyright. While these assets are not physical in nature, they are often the resources that can make or break a company â€“ the value of a brand name, for instance, should not be underestimated.
