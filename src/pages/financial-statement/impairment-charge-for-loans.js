    <Content>
      Not only borrowers but banks and other lenders may also be hit by charges if they realise they have made a poor deal.  A substantial loan impairment charge could be paid by a provider if it approves loans that are unlikely to be repaid. Loan impairment charges are basically money that is put aside by a bank in case its customers cannot make the required loan repayments, but which will leave a huge dent in a companyâ€™s profits.
