      Depreciation is an accounting method of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life and is used to account for declines in value. Businesses depreciate long-term assets for both tax and accounting purposes. For tax purposes, businesses can deduct the cost of the tangible assets they purchase as business expenses; however, businesses must depreciate these assets according to IRS rules about how and when the company can take the deduction.

      Besides an accounting convention, companies also use depreciation to refer to the loss of market value. Currency and real estate are two examples of assets that can depreciate or lose value. During the infamous Russian ruble crisis in 1998, the ruble lost 25 percent of its value in one day. During the housing crisis of 2008, homeowners in the hardest-hit areas, such as Las Vegas, saw the value of their homes depreciate by as much as 50 percent.

      Amortization is an accounting technique used to lower the cost value of a finite-life or intangible asset incrementally through scheduled charges to income. Amortization is the paying off of debt with a fixed repayment schedule in regular installments over time like with a mortgage or a car loan. It also refers to the spreading out of capital expenses for intangible assets over a specific duration – usually over the asset's useful life – for accounting and tax purposes. Amortization can refer to paying off debt over time in regular installments of interest and principal sufficient to repay the loan in full by maturity. Amortization can also mean the deduction of capital expenses over the asset's useful life. In this case, amortization measures the consumption of the value of an intangible asset such as goodwill, a patent or a copyright.
